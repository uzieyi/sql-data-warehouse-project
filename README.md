# Data Warehouse and Analytics project


Building a Modern data warehouse with SQL Server,  including ETL processes, data modelling and analytics. 

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.


## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

  1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into the SQL Server Database.
  2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardisation, and normalisation processes to prepare data for analysis.
  3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modelled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## üìñ Project Overview
This project involves:

1. Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
2. ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. Data Modelling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimised for analytical queries.
4. Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## üöÄ Project Requirements

Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

Objective

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications

  - Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
  - Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
  - Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
  - Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
  - Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.


## BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

Objective

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

  - Customer Behaviour
  - Product Performance
  - Sales Trends
  - ## You can find the [complete data exploration and analysis project here](https://github.com/uzieyi/sql-exploratory-data-analytics-project.git)
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
